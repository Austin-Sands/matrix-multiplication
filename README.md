The prompt for this project was to use the provided header and cpp file for the matrix object given by the professor and write a program that can manipulate the matrices using threads. 
The program uses threads to multiply two matrices (also provided by the professor) and then calculates the sum of all elements, mean, and standard deviation.
The program starts a timer at the beginning of operation and gets runtime after completion of the task.
